## TODO

- Refactor this project to modern Python packaging and tooling:
- Adopt `uv` for environment and dependency management.
- Introduce a `pyproject.toml` as the single project configuration source.
- Apply modern Python development best practices (project layout, tooling, lint/format/test setup, and reproducible workflows).
